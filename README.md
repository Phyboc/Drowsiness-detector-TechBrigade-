# Drowsiness Detector – Team TechBrigade

## Project Overview
This project detects driver drowsiness using **ESP32-CAM** and **ESP32-DevKit**.  
It monitors **eye blinking** and **head tilting** via an Edge Impulse ML model.  
If the driver’s eyes remain closed for more than 2 seconds, a buzzer is triggered to alert them.  

Built for **SmartCityX Hackathon – Urban Infrastructure (2D Model Track)**.
